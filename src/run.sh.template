# READ THIS -- IMPORTANT!                                  #

# This is an example of a script that starts the server    #
# configured for development. You should:                  #
# 1. Copy this script to "run.sh" (changes will be ignored #
#    by git that way, which is desirable)                  #
# 2. Fill the blanks in with your information              #
# 3. Make "run.sh" executable (run "chmod u+x run.sh")     #
# 4. Delete this box - you don't need it anymore, and it's #
#    sort of ugly                                          #
#                                                          #
# To then start the server, you would run "./run.sh" in    #
# the /src directory. You will likely have to set up port  #
# forwarding and/or a reverse proxy; that is beyond the    #
# scope of these instructions.                             #
#                                                          #
# This is not production ready code; do not attempt to     #
# deploy this application in a production environment.     #
#                                                          #
# NOTE: commented variables are optional, but restrict the #
# functionality of the application if left blank!          #
